# Portfolio
my portfolio website

This is my portfolio website that features my background and experience for potential employers. 
It was a good practice in building something from scratch using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I used 
the Bootstrap library as well to ease coding.

It has links to my Github account that has my project repositories. There is a contact form 
that can be filled to reach out to me.
